## What You Can Do

### 1. **Visual Asset Performance Cards**
- See all your assets at a glance with individual performance cards
- Each card shows:
  - **Performance Score**: Composite score (0-100) based on NPV, IRR, Production, and Break-even
  - **Well Count**: Total and active wells per asset
  - **Total Production**: Current production (BBL/day)
  - **Portfolio NPV**: Total NPV for the asset
  - **Average IRR**: Mean IRR across all wells
  - **Break-Even Price**: Average break-even oil price
  - **Total EUR**: Estimated Ultimate Recovery

### 2. **Interactive Charts**
Five key comparison charts help you visualize asset performance:

#### Total NPV by Asset
- Bar chart showing total NPV for each asset
- Sorted from highest to lowest
- Quickly identify your most valuable assets

#### Total Production by Asset
- Current production levels across all assets
- Sorted by production volume
- Spot production leaders and laggards

#### Average IRR by Asset
- Compare returns on investment across assets
- Higher IRR = better returns
- Identify capital allocation opportunities

#### Well Count by Asset
- See asset sizes by well count
- Understand asset maturity and scale
- Plan future development

#### Average Break-Even Price by Asset
- Lower break-even = better economics
- Sorted from lowest to highest (best to worst)
- Identify most resilient assets in low oil price scenarios

### 3. **Performance Rankings**

Four ranking tables show top performers:

#### Top Assets by NPV
- Top 5 assets ranked by total NPV
- Dollar value shown in millions
- Focus on value creation

#### Top Assets by Production
- Top 5 by current production (BBL/day)
- Identify production champions
- Optimize operational focus

#### Top Assets by IRR
- Top 5 by average IRR (%)
- Best returns on capital
- Guide future investment decisions

#### Lowest Break-Even Prices
- Top 5 assets with lowest break-even costs
- Most economically resilient
- Safe bets in volatile markets

### 4. **Detailed Asset Metrics Table**

Comprehensive table with 11 columns:
- **Asset Name**
- **Wells**: Total (Active count)
- **Total Production**: BBL/day across all active wells
- **Avg Prod/Well**: Production per well average
- **Total NPV**: Portfolio NPV in millions
- **Avg IRR**: Average IRR percentage
- **Break-Even**: Average break-even oil price ($/BBL)
- **Total EUR**: Estimated Ultimate Recovery (MBBL)
- **Avg Drilling Days**: Average time to drill
- **Avg Well Cost**: Average well cost (MM$)
- **Performance Score**: Composite score with color coding

---

## Performance Score Explained

The **Performance Score** (0-100) is a weighted composite metric:

- **30% NPV**: Total Net Present Value
- **25% IRR**: Average Internal Rate of Return
- **25% Production**: Total current production
- **20% Break-Even**: Lower break-even = higher score

### Score Interpretation:
- **70-100 (Green)**: Excellent - Top-tier performer
- **50-69 (Blue)**: Good - Solid performer
- **0-49 (Yellow)**: Average - Needs attention
